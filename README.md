## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for setting up a development environment on a CentOS 7.9 virtual machine (VM). The environment includes various components such as Apache Tomcat, Subversion (SVN), Maven, Apache, PHP, Payara Server, multiple versions of Java, WebLogic Server, Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.

1. Download the CentOS 7.9 ISO Image From centos.interhost

    ```sh
    http://centos.interhost.net.il/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/
    ```

2. Install Oracle VM Box From Oracle Download Page
    - For Windows users, download the appropriate Windows installer from the Oracle Download Page:

        ```sh
        https://www.oracle.com/eg/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html
        ```

    - Note: If you are using a different operating system, make sure to download the version suitable for your OS.

## Java Installation Guide

# Installing  Multiple Versions of Java and Set Default (Java 8)
This Ansible playbook automates the installation of various Java versions on a target machine, with the earlier version (Java 8) set as the default. It gives developers the flexibility they need if their applications require different Java versions.
I choose to install Oracle Java (8,11) versions since WebLogic installation cannot be proceed because the open-jdk is no longer supported any more.

# Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running the playbook:

- **Access to Oracle Java Archives:** Ensure access to the Oracle Java archives for Java 8 and Java 11 versions. The playbook uses direct download links to fetch these archives. and those direct links are temporary because to download from the Oracle page, you have to sign in and accept the Oracle OTN license and terms.
So I got those links from my login session; they have a limit 3 times only to be downloaded. Of course,Â  this is not the best approach. You can download them and upload them to a central server; you can use S3 buckets or any other service for example.
- **Ansible:**  Ensure Ansible is installed on the local system from which the playbook will be executed.
- **Target Host:**  The playbook assumes execution on the localhost, but it can be modified to target other hosts as needed.

Assuming that our virtual machine (VM) is accessible to the public, I wanted to emulate the process, so I used the command `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8088/tcp` to open port 8080 within our VM. I also adjusted the VM network settings from our Oracle VM VirtualBox to port forward from my host machine to the VM (guest) port.
