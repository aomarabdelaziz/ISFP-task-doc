## :reminder_ribbon: Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for setting up a development environment on a CentOS 7.9 virtual machine (VM). The environment includes various components such as Apache Tomcat, Subversion (SVN), Maven, Apache, PHP, Payara Server, multiple versions of Java, WebLogic Server, Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.

1. Download the CentOS 7.9 ISO Image From centos.interhost

    ```sh
    http://centos.interhost.net.il/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/
    ```

2. Install Oracle VM Box From Oracle Download Page
    - For Windows users, download the appropriate Windows installer from the Oracle Download Page:

        ```sh
        https://www.oracle.com/eg/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html
        ```

    - Note: If you are using a different operating system, make sure to download the version suitable for your OS.

# Installing  Multiple Versions of Java and Set Default (Java 8)
This Ansible playbook automates the installation of various Java versions on a target machine, with the earlier version (Java 8) set as the default. It gives developers the flexibility they need if their applications require different Java versions.
I choose to install Oracle Java (8,11) versions since WebLogic installation cannot be proceed because the open-jdk is no longer supported any more.

# Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running the playbook:

- **Access to Oracle Java Archives:** Ensure access to the Oracle Java archives for Java 8 and Java 11 versions. The playbook uses direct download links to fetch these archives. and those direct links are temporary because to download from the Oracle page, you have to sign in and accept the Oracle OTN license and terms.
So I got those links from my login session; they have a limit 3 times only to be downloaded. Of course,Â  this is not the best approach. You can download them and upload them to a central server; you can use S3 buckets or any other service for example.
- **Ansible:**  Ensure Ansible is installed on the local system from which the playbook will be executed.
- **Target Host:**  The playbook assumes execution on the localhost, but it can be modified to target other hosts as needed.

    mirrors
    | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.

    | it to several places.
    |
    | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
    | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
    | server for that repository.

    profiles
    | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
    | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
    | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
    |
    | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
    | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
    | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
    |
    | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
    | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
    | relies on the detection of a property, either matching a particular value for the property,
    | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
    | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
    | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
    |
    | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
    |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
    |       variables for plugins in the POM.
    |
    |
    -->
    <profiles>
    <!--
    profile
        | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
        | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
        | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
        |
        | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
        | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
        | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
        | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
        |
        | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
        <profile>
        <id>jdk-1.4</id>

        <activation>
            <jdk>1.4</jdk>
        </activation>

        <repositories>
            <repository>
            <id>jdk14</id>

        </profile>
        
    -->
    <!--

        | Here is another profile, activated by the property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev', which
        | provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance. To use this, your plugin configuration might
        | hypothetically look like:
        |
        | ...
        | <plugin>
        |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
        |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>

        |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
        |   </configuration>
        | </plugin>
        | ...
        |
        | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone set 'target-env' to
        |       anything, you could just leave off the <value/> inside the activation-property.
        |
        <profile>
        <id>env-dev</id>

        <activation>

  - **Start Tomcat Service:**  It starts the Tomcat service using the `startup.sh` script.
  - **Check Tomcat Service Status:** It verifies whether the Tomcat service is running by searching for the process using ps command.
  - **Debug Message:** It provides a debug message indicating whether Tomcat is running or not.

I also adjusted the VM network settings from our oracle VMbox to port forward from my host machine to the VM (guest) port.
