# Installing  Multiple Versions of Java and Set Default (Java 8)
This Ansible playbook automates the installation of various Java versions on a target machine, with the earlier version (Java 8) set as the default. It gives developers the flexibility they need if their applications require different Java versions.
I choose to install Oracle Java (8,11) versions since WebLogic installation cannot be proceed because the open-jdk is no longer supported any more.

# Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running the playbook:

- **Access to Oracle Java Archives:** Ensure access to the Oracle Java archives for Java 8 and Java 11 versions. The playbook uses direct download links to fetch these archives. and those direct links are temporary because to download from the Oracle page, you have to sign in and accept the Oracle OTN license and terms.
So I got those links from my login session; they have a limit 3 times only to be downloaded. Of course,Â  this is not the best approach. You can download them and upload them to a central server; you can use S3 buckets or any other service for example.
- **Ansible:**  Ensure Ansible is installed on the local system from which the playbook will be executed.
- **Target Host:**  The playbook assumes execution on the localhost, but it can be modified to target other hosts as needed.

  - **Install PHP Package:**It installs the `PHP` package using yum to enable server-side scripting support.
  - **Add Docker Repository:** It adds the `Docker repository` to the system configuration to fetch `Docker packages`.
  - **Install Docker File:**  It installs `Docker CE (Community Edition)` using the Docker repository configured earlier.
  - **Start Docker Service**   It starts the `Docker service` and ensures that it is enabled to start automatically on system boot.
  - **Change Permissions of `/var/run/docker.sock`** It adjusts the `permissions` of the Docker socket file to allow Docker commands to be executed without `requiring root privileges`.

# Loading Lines into Dictionary and Comparing Source with Destination

This Python script automates the process of comparing lines from a source file with multiple destination files and outputs the results into an output file. Here's how it works:


# Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running the script:

- **Python:**  Ensure Python is installed on the local system from which the script will be executed.

# Script Structure

```yaml
import os

def load_lines_into_dict(directory_path):
    files_in_directory = os.listdir(directory_path)
    lines_found = {}
    for file_name in files_in_directory:
        file_path_abs = os.path.join(directory_path, file_name)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path_abs):
            with open(file_path_abs, 'r') as file:
                for line in file:
                    file_name_only = os.path.basename(file_path_abs)
                    if line.strip() not in lines_found:
                        lines_found[line.strip()] = [file_name_only]
                    else:
                        lines_found[line.strip()].append(file_name_only)
    return lines_found

def compare_lines_src_dest(lines_dict, output_file):
    with open("source.txt", 'r') as source_file:
        with open(output_file, 'w') as result_file:
            for line in source_file:
                line = line.strip()
                if line in lines_dict:
                    result_file.write(f"{line}'{', '.join(lines_dict[line])}\n")

lines_dict = load_lines_into_dict("./Destination")
compare_lines_src_dest(lines_dict, "output.txt")

```

1. `load_lines_into_dict(directory_path)`: This function takes a directory path as input and loads all the lines from files within that directory into a dictionary. Each line is used as a key, and the value associated with each key is a list of file names where the line is found. `It iterates through each file in the directory, reads its lines`, and populates the dictionary accordingly.

2. `compare_lines_src_dest(lines_dict, output_file)`: This function compares the lines from a source file (source.txt) with the lines loaded into the dictionary using the load_lines_into_dict function. For each line in the source file,` it checks if the line exists in the dictionary`. If it does, `it writes the line along with the file names where it was found into an output file (output.txt)`.

# Create Jenkins server based on docker image

1. This Dockerfile provides instructions for building a custom Jenkins image with Ansible support. Here's a breakdown of the Dockerfile.
2. This Ansible playbook automates the setup of a Jenkins server running within a Docker container, with built-in support for Ansible. It downloads a Dockerfile from a specified URL, builds a Docker image named jenkins-ansible, and then runs a Docker container based on this image.


# Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running the script:

- **Docker:**  Ensure Docker is installed on the local system from which the Dockerfile will be executed.
- **Ansible:**  Ensure Ansible is installed on the local system from which the playbook will be executed.
- **Target Host:**  The playbook assumes execution on the localhost, but it can be modified to target other hosts as needed.

# Dockerfile Structure

```yaml
# Use the official Jenkins image as base
FROM jenkins/jenkins:latest

# Switch to root user to install Ansible and dependencies
USER root

# Install dependencies for Ansible
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    software-properties-common \
    python3-pip \
    python3-venv \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a virtual environment for Ansible
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/ansible

# Activate the virtual environment and install Ansible
RUN /opt/ansible/bin/pip install ansible

# Switch back to the Jenkins user
USER jenkins


```  

1. `Base Image`: It starts with the official Jenkins image (jenkins/jenkins:latest) as the base image.
2. `Switch to Root User`: It switches to the root user to install Ansible and its dependencies.
3. `Install Dependencies`: It updates the `package repositories` and installs necessary dependencies for Ansible, including `software-properties-common`, `python3-pip`, and `python3-venv`.
4. `Create Virtual Environment for Ansible`: It creates a virtual environment for Ansible at /opt/ansible.
5. `Install Ansible`: It activates the virtual environment and installs Ansible within it using pip.
6. `Switch Back to Jenkins User`: Finally, it switches back to the Jenkins user to ensure that Jenkins runs with the appropriate permissions.


# Playbook Structure

```yaml
- name: Run Jenkins with ansible support as a Docker image
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  vars:
    docker_file_download_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aomarabdelaziz/ISFP-task-doc/master/Docker/Dockerfile.jenkins-ansible
    download_path: /tmp/Dockerfile.jenkins-ansible
  tasks:
    - name: Download Dockerfile.jenkins-ansible
      get_url:
        url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aomarabdelaziz/ISFP-task-doc/master/Docker/Dockerfile.jenkins-ansible"
        dest: "{{ download_path }}"

    - name: Build Docker image
      command: "docker build -t jenkins-ansible -f {{download_path}} ."

    - name: Run Jenkins container
      shell: "docker run --name jenkins --network=host -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -d -v $(which docker):$(which docker) jenkins-ansible"
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Pause for 10 seconds before getting initial admin password
      pause:
        seconds: 10

    - name: Get initial admin password
      shell: docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
      register: initial_admin_password
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Print the secret
      debug:
        msg: "The initial admin password is {{ initial_admin_password.stdout }}"
      when: initial_admin_password.rc == 0 # Only print if the command succeeds


```  

- **hosts:**  Specifies the target host where the playbook tasks will be executed. In this case, it's set to localhost.
- **vars:**   Defines variables used throughout the playbook, including download URL of custom image , download folder location.
- **tasks:** Contains the main tasks of the playbook
  - **Download Dockerfile:** The playbook starts by downloading the Dockerfile necessary for building the Jenkins Docker image from the provided URL.
  - **Build Docker Image:**It then builds a Docker image named jenkins-ansible using the downloaded Dockerfile.
  - **Run Jenkins Container:** It creates a script file `(maven.sh)` in the /etc/profile.d directory to set up environment variables for Maven.
  - **Clear Content of maven.sh File:** After building the Docker image, the playbook runs a Docker container named jenkins, which hosts the Jenkins server. The container is configured to have network access to the host (--network=host), mount the Jenkins home directory (-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home), and have access to the Docker socket (-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock). This enables Jenkins to interact with Docker for running jobs.
  - **Delay Before Retrieving Initial Admin Password**  To ensure that Jenkins is fully initialized, a pause of 10 seconds is introduced before attempting to retrieve the initial admin password.
  - **Retrieve Initial Admin Password:**  The playbook then retrieves the initial admin password for Jenkins from the container's secrets directory (/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword) using the docker exec command.
  - **Print Initial Admin Password**  Finally, the initial admin password is printed to the console, provided that the retrieval command succeeds.
